## Gerrard Malleus

“Let the first act of every morning be to make the following resolve for the day:
- I shall not fear anyone on Earth.
- I shall not bear ill will toward anyone.
- I shall not submit to injustice from anyone.
- I shall conquer untruth by truth. And in resisting untruth, I shall put up with all suffering.”
  Justice. That is the underpinning of Gerrard Malleus. He has always sought what was just and fair. For the longest time, going back to the days of high school, he always stepped up when the fight was not fair. Born into a middle class family that lived on the wrong side of the tracks, Gerrard faced many fights: race, class, and gangs. With proper training, he would not only take his lumps, but dish them out to those who targeted the vulnerable. This dogged determinism helped him graduate from Mist City's law school magma cum laude. Wanting to protect those who faced pressure from the elite or the gang lords of the southside, Gerrard joined the District Attorney's office. He quickly excelled and became known for winning legal battles where the deck was stacked against him.

Yet there was a duality to Gerrard's life. He manifested his powers when a gang decided to exact vengeance at a particularly brilliant court battle. The gang leader Morpheus was incarcertated on some lesser charge, but it still cleared the streets of a major player. Just as the gang was beating him to an inch of his life, he heard the voice. "Do you vow to walk on the side of law and order? Do you wish to become the embodiment of justice?" In this desperate circumstance, Gerrard readily accepted and he was transformed into...

## Marduk, God of Justic

He felt the surge of the Indominable Will replenish his body. While still bloody and broken, his drive overcame the pain receptors and he threw off his attackers. Raising his hand, he called down The Mace of Shedu, his spiked cudgel, to dispense justice to those who oppose the law. Justice was dispensed quickly. Then raising his hand to his ear, Elemental Whispers gave him signs, portents, and direct clues as to the reason for his attack. It was Morpheus. Evidently, the bars of prison would not contain that particular fiend. However, now Morpheus would need to content with both Gerrard Malleus and Marduk; the fight will be in the courtroom and in the streets.


Ultimately, Marduk looked to find other individuals who could help him combat the reach of Morpheus. He found others; others with powers as remarkable as his own. How can one of the oldest avatars be meshed into "The New Gods"? Simple. Justice never gets old.
